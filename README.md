# Homzy - A Real Estate Website

![Dashboard](https://github.com/prazivi/Real_State_FullStack/blob/master/Project%20snip/DashBoard.JPG)

## Overview

Homzy is a real estate website that simplifies the process of buying and selling properties. It provides a user-friendly interface for property owners to list their properties and for potential buyers to search and view available properties. The website allows users to search for properties in any location and view surrounding areas to get a better understanding of the neighborhood. Additionally, users can like and add properties to their favorites list for future reference. To enhance security and provide a seamless authentication experience, Auth0 is used for both client-side and server-side authentication. The UI components are developed with Mantine to ensure a polished and responsive user interface.

## Key Features

- Property Search: Users can search for properties in any location using the search functionality. The website also provides the ability to view areas around a property on a map.

- Favorites List: Logged-in users can like properties and add them to their favorites list for easy access and comparison.

- User Authentication: Auth0 is integrated into the website to handle user authentication securely.

- Login and Signup: Users can create an account and log in to access additional features and save their preferences.
